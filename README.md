This is a text-graph network developed using Sigma JS, Scala, and Coffeescript. Essentially this application
pulls member data from a website called chatwork and displays text-graph network for each chatwork that a user is apart
of. 

If you wish to use this application please change chatwork.accesskey inside application.conf as that key is just a demokey.
